## **Define**  

**Problem Statement**:  
The current system for managing and applying sanctions (Warning or Suspension) for learners relies on the manual calculation of absences, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This lack of automation leads to inconsistencies, reduces transparency, and creates confusion among learners about the rules, ultimately misaligning with the overall training objectives.
